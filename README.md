#### Chapter 1 Homework

##### 1. Find grammars for  = {a, b} that generate the sets of
(a) all strings with at least three a's.

(b) all strings with an even number of b's.

(c) all strings in {a3nb2n: n 2}

##### 2. Give a simple description of the language generated by the grammarwith productions
S  aaA

A  bS

S  

##### 3. Find a grammar that generates the language L = {wwR : w  {a, b}+}

##### 4. Suppose that in some programming language, numbers are restricted as follows:
(a) a number may be signed (with + or – symbol) or unsigned.

(b) the value field consists of two nonempty parts, separated by a
decimal point.

(c) there is an optional exponent field. If present, this field must contain the letter e, followed by a signed two-digit integer.

For example, +12.25, -20.45e+10, 35.1e-02. Design a grammar set of such numbers.
