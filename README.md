#### Homework #2

##### 1. For Σ = {a, b}, construct dfa’s that accept the sets consisting of
(a) all strings with no more than two a’s.

(b) all strings with at least one b and exactly two a’s. (hint: label the state by a two-digit number such that the first digit represents the number of a's and the second digit represents the number of b's.)

##### 2. Find an nfa with four states for L = {an : n  0}  {bna : n1}.

##### 3. Convert the nfa defined by
δ(q0, a) = {q0, q1}

δ(q1, b) = {q1, q2}

δ(q2, a) = {q2}

δ(q0, λ) = {q2}

with initial state q0 and final state q2 into an equivalent dfa.

##### 4. Show that if L is regular, so is LR.

##### 5. Given the following dfa:

Find a minimal equivalent dfa.
